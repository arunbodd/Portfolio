# Strengths

This page provides documentation for the Strengths section of my portfolio website.

## Overview

The Strengths page highlights my core professional strengths and soft skills that complement my technical abilities. This section helps visitors understand my working style, approach to problem-solving, and interpersonal qualities.

## Page Structure

The Strengths page includes:

- Visual representations of key strengths
- Brief descriptions of each strength
- Examples of how these strengths apply to professional scenarios
- Consistent styling with the portfolio's dark theme

## Implementation Details

The Strengths page is implemented as a React component using styled-components for styling. It maintains the consistent dark theme with navy blues and teal highlights that is used throughout the portfolio.

### Key Components

- `StrengthCard`: Card component displaying individual strength
- `StrengthIcon`: Visual representation of the strength

## Data Structure

The Strengths page uses a data structure that defines each strength:

```javascript
const strengthsData = [
  {
    title: "Problem Solving",
    icon: "problem-solving-icon.svg",
    description: "Analytical approach to identifying and resolving complex issues..."
  },
  // Additional strengths...
];
```

Each strength includes:
