# Icon Replacement Instructions

The repository has been renamed from "Portfolio" to "OmicsQ" and all GitHub links have been updated. To complete the transformation, please replace the current React logo with a professional avatar icon that represents the OmicsQ platform.

## Files to Replace

1. `/public/favicon.ico` - The browser tab icon
2. `/public/logo192.png` - Small logo for PWA and mobile
3. `/public/logo512.png` - Large logo for PWA and splash screens

## Suggested Icon Design

For the OmicsQ platform, consider an icon design that represents omics data analysis and visualization:

- **Color Scheme**: Navy blue background (#0a192f) with teal accents (#64ffda)
- **Design Elements**: 
  - A stylized "OQ" monogram
  - Abstract DNA helix or data visualization elements
  - Clean, professional look with minimal design

## Design Tools

You can use any of these tools to create your icon:
- Adobe Illustrator
- Figma

Replace the existing files in the `/public` directory with your new icons.
